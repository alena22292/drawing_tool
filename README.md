Goal: GeoJSON is good tool to create a data in JSON format. It allows you to draw lolygons and other geometry figures. 
However I really would like to trace all needed coordinates from a picture (concept of a new living area with buildings). 

This tool allows you to create polygons and lines on the map. 
The user may toggle over an interactive map and a canvas due to choose either the darwing tool or map coordinates. 

The may adjust the needed picture over the map as an icon (there is still a little bug because the icon size is not fixed on the map).
Zooming in/out on the map would change position of the picture as an icon.
An icon anchor has only one coordinate pair if to compare with an image that has two pair of coordinates. 

Next important tool for this map is to be able to import the file as SVG and JSON.
